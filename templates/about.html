<p>Hello, I work as a data analyst in Chicago, IL. In my free time I learn new programming languages and tools, make a little art, make a little music, daydream, bike around, and think about all the young adult fiction I used to read.</p>

<p>This website has undergone a couple transitions from a jekyll blog hosted on github, to a jekyll blog hosted via Gandhi, toa blog hosted on a VPS running Apache, to this Django version hosted on a VPS running nginx. Soon I will set the blog portion back up, it got lost somewhere along the way.</p>
